# QuantumWell
# Displaying wave function of a particle in various potential well  in quantum mechanic. (Only one dimension)
  In Newtonian mechanics a particle moving in a well of potential energy has any amount of energy. 
  The position and velocity of this particle can be determined with certainty, but in quantum mechanics the energy of a particle trapped in 
  the potential well is quantized. The location of a particle can be expressed in terms of the probability of finding a particle 
  in that area, which requires finding the particle's wave function first. The equation used to describe the behavior of this particle is the Schrödinger equation.
Here we will simulate a situation where a particle (electrons) is trapped in various potential wells, considering only the 1D case.

<b>How to compile these source code.</b>
- Making a directory and subdirectory as in picture

- Press 'Window key + r' to open 'Command Shell' then type 'cmd + enter key' After Command shell window appears, go into
  'D:\QuantumWell' directory.

- Compile all java file under 'src' directory
               D:\QuantumWell>javac -cp . -d . ./src/*.java

- If there is no error. you will get a lot of '.class' file in a new 'SE1D' directory ( SE1D stands for Schrödinger Equation in 1 Dimension)

- If some errors occur , you maybe add '-encoding utf8' in the line of compile command.

- Don't forget to copy these image files (f1.gif, f2.gif, f3.gif, f4.gif and f5.gif ) from 'src' folder to 'SE1D' folder
- Test driving this programm

  If everythig is alright. you will see as following picture.
